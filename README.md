LeRoy Jaime, a novice programmer, is perplexed by the annoying habit of his younger brother, Koby Brian. The latter likes to play with words, making it difficult for LeRoy, and the entire family to understand him. Their father then instructed LeRoy to decipher the language of his younger sibling. LeRoy accepted the challenge.
LeRoy observed Koby for a week and found out that the secret to Koby's mysterious language is rotation. He discovered that given a number N, the letters of a word is rotated N number of times to the left, forming a new word. In addition, Koby also adds a su_x to the word, making it even more obscure. To make matters worse, Koby changes N and the length of from time to time.
LeRoy then comes to you and asks for help. Your task is to create a program to decode Koby's
words.
